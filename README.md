# Hi, I'm Heshan 👋

I build **Python-based web automation and scraping solutions** using **Playwright**, focused on reliability, speed, and real-world use cases.

I enjoy automating repetitive web tasks, extracting structured data from modern websites, and working close to how browsers actually behave.

## 🛠️ Core Skills & Tools

### Web Automation & Scraping
- **Playwright (Python):** Browser automation, page interaction, form handling, navigation, and data extraction  
- **Web Scraping:** Handling dynamic content, pagination, selectors, and basic anti-bot awareness  
- **Automation Scripts:** Replacing manual workflows with repeatable Python scripts  

### Data Handling
- **Python:** Data cleaning, structuring, CSV/JSON output  
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Basic processing and transformation of scraped data  

### Web & Systems Basics
- **HTML & CSS:** Understanding page structure for accurate scraping  
- **Linux & Bash:** Working comfortably in Linux environments, scripts, and tooling

## 📂 Selected Projects
*(More coming as I build and polish repositories)*

- **Web Automation Scripts:** Playwright-based automation for navigation, form submission, and scraping  
- **Data Extraction Tools:** Scripts that collect, clean, and export structured web data  
- **Utility Automation:** Small Python tools for repetitive or time-consuming tasks  

> Repositories focus on **clarity, real-world patterns, and maintainability** rather than demos only.

## 🧠 Currently Learning
- Advanced Playwright patterns (contexts, waits, robustness)
- Web automation at scale
- Linux internals & scripting
- **Cybersecurity fundamentals & penetration testing**

## 🔐 Cybersecurity & Pentesting Path
I’m actively building a foundation in offensive security to strengthen my understanding of systems and web behavior.

- **Platforms:** Hack The Box (HTB)
- **Focus Areas:** Networking, enumeration, system logic
- **Goal:** Move toward practical pentesting skills and certifications
